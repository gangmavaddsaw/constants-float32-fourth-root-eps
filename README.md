## 📜 Description

This repository provides the fourth root of the single-precision floating-point epsilon value, specifically for 32-bit IEEE 754 representations. Understanding floating-point arithmetic is vital in many computing applications, especially in fields such as graphics, scientific computations, and data analysis. 

Epsilon, denoted as `eps`, is the smallest difference between two floating-point numbers. When performing calculations, knowing this value can help avoid errors that arise from precision limitations.

## 🚀 Installation

To use the constants in your JavaScript or Node.js projects, you can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install constants-float32-fourth-root-eps
```

## 🔧 Usage

After installation, you can import the constant in your JavaScript code as follows:

```javascript
const fourthRootEps = require('constants-float32-fourth-root-eps');

// Now you can use fourthRootEps in your calculations
console.log(fourthRootEps);
```

The constant `fourthRootEps` holds the fourth root of the float32 epsilon. It provides a useful precision threshold for floating-point calculations.

## 📊 Examples

### Example 1: Precision Check

Here's a simple function to demonstrate how you might use this constant to check the precision of floating-point operations:

```javascript
const fourthRootEps = require('constants-float32-fourth-root-eps');

function isWithinPrecision(a, b) {
    return Math.abs(a - b) < fourthRootEps;
}

// Test with numbers
const a = 0.1 + 0.2;
const b = 0.3;

console.log(isWithinPrecision(a, b)); // true
```

### Example 2: Using in Mathematical Functions

You can also leverage this constant in more complex mathematical operations to ensure accuracy:

```javascript
const fourthRootEps = require('constants-float32-fourth-root-eps');

function approximateSquareRoot(num) {
    let guess = num / 2.0;
    let nextGuess = (guess + num / guess) / 2.0;

    while (Math.abs(guess - nextGuess) > fourthRootEps) {
        guess = nextGuess;
        nextGuess = (guess + num / guess) / 2.0;
    }
    
    return guess;
}

console.log(approximateSquareRoot(16)); // Output: 4
```
